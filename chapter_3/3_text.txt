3.1

An expression with a ; at the end is a statement.
All blocks are of the form:
Keyword ()
	statement

When a single statement does not suffice, we use
{
	...
}

The block within the {} is called as a compound statement and is eqiuvalent to
a statement.


3.2

if executes first statement following it if the condition expression has
nonzero value
To avoid confusion, the first if before the else statement is considered as
it's if
i.e
if (c1)
	if (c2)
		statement1
else
	statement2

Here, else will NOT be executed if c1 == 0, but if c1 != 0 and c2 == 0

"cases are just labels" -K&R
Now you know why there is fall through
The expression which is 'switched' must be an integer or a character

When using comma operator is used in for loops, evalutation is done from left
to right. (So one could, in fact put the body of the for loop in the updation 
statement (statement 1, statement 2, ... , 'actual increment')	
But "That, (to quote Richard Nixon) would be wrong"
Why for loops are handy - when you 'continue' in for, updation occurs, wheras
it does not occur when you are using artificial updation in while loops
break breaks out of the current for or switch block

Though using goto is not banned, (otherwise the masters of C would never have put it in the language
Sane people are advised not to use it (except as K&R says, use it in case of a
	HUGE jump which would require too many status variables
